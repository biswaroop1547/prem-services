The goal of training these models is to create a representation of human language that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, question- Answering and sentiment analysis. These models typically consist of several layers of neural networks, with each layer representing a different aspect of language (e.g., word meaning, syntax, context). As the model gets larger, it has the ability to learn more abstract representations of language that are more representative of human language understanding.\"),\n",
